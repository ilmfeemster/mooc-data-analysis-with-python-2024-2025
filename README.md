# 📊 Python and Data Analysis MOOC (2024–2025)

Welcome to my learning repository for the [**Data Analysis with Python 2024–2025**](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/data-analysis-with-python-2024-2025) course offered by the University of Helsinki and MOOC.fi.

This course is part of my personal and academic journey to build strong foundations in data analysis and statistics using Python. I’m completing it alongside my CS degree and using it as a stepping stone toward applying data analysis in real-world projects — including things like analyzing fantasy football data and preparing for future work in AI and machine learning.
